NEEDED AS FIRST
when trying to go to the direction opposite of the current one, the accel should be accel + decel until velocity zeroes
objects are not called while out of screen, but doors dont open and big objects are not drawn is a problem
add player to the layers, make better layering mechanics

dont forget projectile collision with collidables
maybe make a class called moveable, and generalize collision methods for all movables
fill component classes/interfaces

design the shop, first design the crystal palace
fix the selection's world index gimmick, change the 13-14 indexed levels, make them make sense
add signal handling: next, shop, selection, death...
add random rewards to the in between every x levels

make the buff symbols, and add the buff mechanics.
generalize mud and special tile to the 4 worlds

add skin to test
add skin with default size big and small to test
accessories size and coordinate changes are needed!


NEW MECHANICS, FUTURE IDEAS
generalize projectile direction to 360
homing missiles, aiming monsters
fake wall
moving monsters
shooting monsters
in game currency, shop
boss


INCREASE FLEXIBILITY
general interfaces and component classes holding important information
tracking component?

NEW CLASS IDEAS //BELA ARAMAK

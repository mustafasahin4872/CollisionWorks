NEEDED AS FIRST

add sound effects to: worlds, player damaged, player shooting, coin collection, different backg sound when critical health
the always called objects should be called in collision checks of projectiles as well
the empty grid object collision trigger for projectile and else addition
renew always called mechanic and fix the moving entity check problems
mines dont have to be gridObjects
buttons that needs to be held to stay pushed(triggered by monsters as wll)
movable boxes to block projectiles or keep buttons pushed
player shooting mechanism fşxxx
when item expires its spawnobjects stop getting calls
check 2 projectiles collision
when 2 movingcollidables, 1 squeeze the other from the left or up, case of teleportation. theories:
better naming on shooter mapmaker
visualise mapmaker
maybe make a class called moveable, and generalize collision methods for all movables
fix collisions, better collision mechanics
maybe ditch the alwayscalledobjects idea

make the buff symbols, and add the buff mechanics.

design the shop, first design the crystal palace
fix the selection's world index gimmick, change the 13-14 indexed levels, make them make sense
add signal handling: next, shop, selection, death...
add random rewards to the in between every x levels

generalize mud and special tile to the 4 worlds

add skin to test
add skin with default size big and small to test
